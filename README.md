TalkRx – AI‑Guided Anxiety Support Built for Responsible Healthcare

1. Inspiration
An estimated 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experience an anxiety disorder each year, yet more than half don’t receive treatment. We noticed two major gaps contributing to that. First, support isn’t always available when people need it most. Therapy requires time, money, and scheduling, which many people can't access on demand. Second, while AI chatbots are widely available, they often lack clinical accuracy, personalization, and trust. Some people also aren’t ready or willing to talk to a therapist directly due to stigma, fear, or just not knowing where to start. We wanted to build something that bridges all those gaps, that's more reliable than Googling symptoms, and more accessible than a therapy session. Our goal was to deliver real-time, evidence-based anxiety support that people can trust and actually use when they need it most.

2. What It Does
TalkRx is a cross‑platform mobile system where anxiety patients chat with an AI companion that can:
Extract an AnxietyProfile – symptoms, triggers, emotions, evidence, and a provisional DSM‑5‑TR / ICD‑10 diagnosis.
Suggest evidence‑based next steps – psycho‑education, coping tips, and FDA‑approved (or off‑label) medication options.
Share structured data with providers through FHIR v5 Patient + Observation resources, making human follow‑up fast and safe.
